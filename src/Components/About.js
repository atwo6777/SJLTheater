        Her theatrical philosophy starts within dramaturgical research into the
        story to find the motifs that lay throughout the story to bring to the
        table to collaborate with. From there the amount of abstraction within
        the conceptual development is, hopefully for them, completely
        collaborative. Utilizing angles first and foremost with the addition of
        texture and color that is rooted within the story, she hopes to bring
        the beauty of the internal world of the piece to the stage.

        She has also had the opportunity to work on projection integrated into
        their design, from both outside collaborators and designing them
        herself. She is proficient on ETC Eos, Cobalt, High End Hog systems, and
        able to manipulate GrandMA consoles at a reasonable caliber. Her
        programming prowise on Eos has seen her busk (or live program) well into
        the thousands of concerts, dance, theater, and events.
